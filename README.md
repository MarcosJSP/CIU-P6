# Image and video processing - by MarcosJSP

The objective of this project is to familiarize myself with image and video processing. For the sake of this i made three different camera filters as you can see here:

## Development

- Trace effect [key 1]

The moving items leave a trace wherever they move from. This effect is achieved by drawing just a limited amount of the pixels captured by the camera into the screen each frame.



- Brightness effect [key 2]

The screen is filled with circles that grow bigger the lighter the pixels captured by the camera are.



- Dithering effect [key 3]

The dithering effect is achieved using the [Floydâ€“Steinberg dithering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering)
